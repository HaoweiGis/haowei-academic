abstract: Urban air pollution with PM2.5 as the main pollutant has become
  increasingly prominent in China since 2010. Scholars have conducted many
  studies on how urbanization affects PM2.5, but few concerns about the
  relationship between construction land (CL) expansion and PM2.5 at different
  scales from the perspective of expansion rate. Therefore, this study takes CL
  and PM2.5 data in China to describe the spatiotemporal progress of atmospheric
  environmental pollution and then adopts the overall and spatial coupling
  models to quantitatively reveal the dynamic relationship between them. The
  results indicate that the growth rate of PM2.5-polluted area in China was
  found to increase rapidly for 2000–2010 time period, followed by a continuous
  decline afterward. The annual average growth rates of CL area and
  PM2.5-polluted area within 15 years were 4.43% and 2.46%, respectively.
  Moreover, the barycenter distance between PM2.5 concentration and CL decreased
  gradually, and the two barycenters approached closer. Also, the spatial
  coupling coordination of CL and PM2.5 enhanced in Central, West, and East
  China but weakened in Northeast. Cities with a “very strong” coupling type are
  mainly located in the “Chongqing-Beijing” belt and the lower-middle reaches of
  the Yangtze River. Finally, the spatial coupling model results show that a low
  PM2.5 concentration is closely related to CL expansion. This study will
  provide a basis for cross-regional joint air pollution control and the
  management of heavily polluted areas in China.
