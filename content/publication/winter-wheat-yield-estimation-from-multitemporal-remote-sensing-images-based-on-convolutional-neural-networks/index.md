abstract: The development of deep learning and big data technology has
  introduced information and intelligent techniques to agricultural remote
  sensing estimation. The deep learning methods represented by Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) have abilities to extract the depth-dependent features of
  crop growth. In the field of crop yield estimation, the core challenge is to
  utilize CNN to extract the related information from remote sensing images. In
  this paper, we apply histogram dimensionality reduction and time series fusion
  to generate the input layer of CNN. In view of the data characteristics, the
  CNN network structure was designed to extract the features of winter wheat
  growth from multitemporal MODIS images for yield estimation in North China.
  The results showed that the estimated yield of winter wheat based on
  time-series remote sensing images is highly correlated with statistical data,
  with Pearson's r of 0.82, RMSE of 724.72 kg.hm-2. In the case of sufficient
  statistical data, the provincial model performs better. CNN is able to mine
  more relevant information and has higher robustness. It also provides a
  technical reference for estimating large-scale crop yield.
