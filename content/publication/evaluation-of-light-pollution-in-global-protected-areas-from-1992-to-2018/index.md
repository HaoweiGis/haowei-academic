abstract: "Light pollution, a phenomenon in which artificial nighttime light
  (NTL) changes the form of brightness and darkness in natural areas such as
  protected areas (PAs), has become a global concern due to its threat to global
  biodiversity. With ongoing global urbanization and climate change, the light
  pollution status in global PAs deserves attention for mitigation and
  adaptation. In this study, we developed a framework to evaluate the light
  pollution status in global PAs, using the global NTL time series data. First,
  we classified global PAs (30,624) into three pollution categories:
  non-polluted (5974), continuously polluted (8,141), and discontinuously
  polluted (16,509), according to the time of occurrence of lit pixels in/around
  PAs from 1992 to 2018. Then, we explored the NTL intensity (e.g., digital
  numbers) and its trend in those polluted PAs and identified those hotspots of
  PAs at the global scale with consideration of global urbanization. Our study
  shows that global light pollution is mainly distributed within the range of
  30°N and 60°N, including Europe, north America, and East Asia. Although the
  temporal trend of NTL intensity in global PAs is increasing, Japan and the
  United States of America (USA) have opposite trends due to the implementation
  of well-planned ecological conservation policies and declining population
  growth. For most polluted PAs, the lit pixels are close to their boundaries
  (i.e., less than 10 km), and the NTL in/around these lit areas has become
  stronger over the past decades. The identified hotspots of PAs (e.g., Europe,
  the USA, and East Asia) help support decisions on global biodiversity
  conservation, particularly with global urbanization and climate change."
