abstract: Community is the core spatial unit for evaluating sustainable
  development. However, single data and method seem inadequate for conducting a
  scientific, effective, and innovative sustainable evaluation of complex
  community units. In this study, we perform a sustainable-oriented land use
  scheme using multisource remote sensing, machine learning, and object-based
  post-classification refinement. Furthermore, we assess the sustainability of
  the traffic community by data-driven and combined housing, ecosystem services,
  and landscape configuration. The results indicated that (1) the relationship
  between housing, ecosystem services, and landscape pattern has obvious
  synergistic effects, although with dissimilar importance in different
  sustainability levels. High sustainability level is intensely coordinated with
  landscape configuration, medium sustainability level is more affected by
  ecosystem services, and low sustainability level is more related to housing.
  (2) Community sustainability presents a significant spatial distribution. The
  communities of high sustainability level are mainly located in both sides of
  the Pearl River and emerging urban areas, while those of medium sustainability
  level are distributed sporadically in the study area and those of low
  sustainability level are concentrated in old towns. (3) Community
  transformation cannot be accomplished at one step. Along with the continuous
  optimization of landscape configuration, the priority should be given to
  housing reconstruction and improvement of ecosystem services further. We
  provide scientific and effective data-based evidence for urban decision-makers
  by integrating the advantages of the Earth Observation System and multifactor
  analysis.
