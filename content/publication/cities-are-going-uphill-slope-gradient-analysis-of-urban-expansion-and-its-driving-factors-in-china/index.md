abstract: Rapid urbanisation causes large urban conversions of natural and
  agricultural land to non-agricultural use. Research on urban expansion has
  typically disregarded gradient characteristics. The current study uses slope
  data calculated based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital
  Elevation Model data set and multi-period land cover data derived from China's
  Multi-Period Land Use Land Cover Remote Sensing Monitoring data set to reveal
  the evolution of spatiotemporal patterns of vertical urban expansion in China
  from 1990 to 2015. A built-up land climbing index is specifically defined to
  measure the increasing use of land with slopes. A slope-climbing phenomenon
  has become increasingly apparent over time. Although built-up land with slopes
  below 5° accounts for over 85% of the total, this proportion has declined
  steadily from 89.53% in 1990 to 86.61% in 2015. The number of cities where
  built-up land was developed on high slopes (over 5°) increased from 150 to
  238. Slope-climbing intensity spatially increased from north to south, and
  showed a “low–high–low” pattern from west to east. In addition, built-up land
  showed evident slope-climbing trend in areas with high variation in slope.
  Slope-climbing intensity was high for cities located in mountains and ethnic
  autonomous prefectures. Lastly, cities going uphill are subjected to the
  combined effects of natural environmental conditions and social factors. The
  average slope and population growth have significantly positive impact on
  slope-climbing intensity.
