abstract: "Along with the rapid development of China’s economy as well as the
  continuing urbanization, the internal spatial and functional structures of
  cities within this country are also gradually changing and restructuring. The
  study of functional region identification of a city is of great significance
  to the city’s functional cognition, spatial planning, economic development,
  human livability, and so forth. Backed by the emerging urban Big Data, and
  taking the traffic community as the smallest research unit, a method is
  proposed to identify urban functional regions by combining floating car track
  data with point of interest (POI) data recorded on an electronic map. It
  provides a new perspective for the study of urban functional region
  identification. Firstly, the main functional regions of the city studied are
  identified through clustering analysis according to the passenger’s
  spatial-temporal travel characteristics derived from the floating car data.
  Secondly, the fine-grained identification of the functional region attributes
  of the traffic communities is achieved using the label information from POI
  data. Finally, the AND-OR operation is performed on the recognition results
  derived by the clustering algorithm and the Delphi method, to obtain the
  identification of urban functional regions. This approach is verified by
  applying it to the main urban zone within Chengdu’s Third Ring Road. The
  results show that: (1) There are fewer single functional regions and more
  mixed functional regions in the main urban zone of Chengdu, and the
  distribution of the functional regions are roughly concentric centering in the
  city center. (2) Using the traffic community as a research unit, combined with
  dynamic human activity trajectory data and static urban interest point data,
  complex urban functional regions can be effectively identified. "
